    <h2>Definition of Git workflow:</h2>
    <p>The Git workflow is a set of steps and stages that developers follow to manage and track changes
        effectively using Git, a popular version control system. It involves three main components: the working
        directory, the staging area (also known as the index), and the repository@</p>
    <h2>The Git workflow is divided into three states:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Working Directory</h3>The working directory is the local file system where you create, edit, and organize your
            project files. When you initiate a Git repository in a directory, it becomes a part of the working directory@
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Staging area (Index)</h3>The staging area is where you prepare changes to be committed. It's like a
            holding tank for our changes.Files are added to the staging state using git add command.<br>
            Files in the staged state are modified files that have been selected — in their current state (version) — and are being prepared to be saved (committed) into the .git repository during the next commit

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Git directory (Repository)</h3>The repository, also known as the Git repository or Git database, is where Git permanently
            stores committed snapshots of your project. It contains the complete history of changes, branches, tags, and other Git-related data.
        </li>
