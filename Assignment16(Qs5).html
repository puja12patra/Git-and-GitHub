    <h2>The steps of contributing to any open-source project on GitHub is -</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Find a project to contribute to</h4>
        </li>There are millions of projects on GitHub, so we should be able to find one interests that we have the
        skills to contribute to. We can search for projects by keyword,language or topic.
        <li>
            <h4>Read the project's contributing guidelines</h4>Most projects have a contribution guidelines document
            that explains how to contribute to the project.This document will tell what kind of contributions are,how to
            format our code and how to submit our changes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Create a fork of the project</h4>A fork is a copy of the project that we can make chnages to without
            affecting the main codebase. To create a fork, click the Fork button on the project's page.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Clone the fork to our local computer</h4> Once we have forked the project, we need to clone it to our
            local
            computer. This will create a copy of project on our hard drive which we can work on.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Make our changes </h4> Make the changes to the code that we want to contribute. Be sure to follow the
            project's contribution guidelines and to test our changes thoroughly.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Commit our changes</h4> Once we are done the chnages, commit them to our local repository.This will
            create a
            snapshot of the code at that point in time.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Push our changes to our fork</h4> Once we have commited our chnages,push them to our fork on GitHub.
            This
            will make changes avilable to other developers.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Create a pull request</h4> A pull request is a way to request that our changes be merged into the main
            codebase. To create a pull request,click the pull Requests button on our fork's page.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Wait for our pull request to be reviewed</h4>Other developers will review our changes and provide
            feedback.Once our changes are approved, they will be merged into the main codebase.
        </li>
