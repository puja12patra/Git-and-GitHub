    <h2>Definition of GitHub</h2>
    <p>GitHub is a cloud-Based hosting service that helps developers to store and manage their codes, as well
        as track and control changes to thtir code over time. It also provides a numbers of feathers that make it easy
        for teams to collaborate on software projects.</p>
    <h2>GitHub facilitates collaboration and version control</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Version control:</li>GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system,to track chnages to code.This
        allows developers to see who made what changes and when,and to revert to previous versions of the code if
        necessary.
        <li>Branches and pull requests</li>GitHub makes it easy for developers to create and manage branches of their
        code. This allows developers to work on new features or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase.Once a
        developer is ready to merge their chnages back into the main codebase,they can create a pull request.This allows
        other developers to review the chnges and provide feedback before they are merged.
        <li>Issues and Tasks</li>GitHub provides a way for developers to track issues and tasks related to their code.
        This helps teams to stay organized and to prioritize their work.
        <li>Code Reviews</li>GitHub makes it easy for developers to review each other's code. This helps to improve the
        quality of the code and to identity potential bugs
        <li>Discussions</li>GitHub provides a way for developers to discuss their code and ask questions. This helps to
        promote collaboration and knowledge sharing.
