    <h2>Definition of .gitignore </h2>
    <p>A .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files and folders to ignore. It is usually placed in the
        root directory of a project. When Git sees a .gitignore file, it will ignore any files or folders that are
        listed in the file.</p>
    <p>The .gitignore files are important in version control because they help to keep the repository clean and
        organized. They also prevent developers from accidentally committing unnecessary files to the repository,
        such as log files, build artifacts, and IDE configuration files.<br>Here are some examples of files and folders
        that you might want to ignore in a Git repository: - personal secret
        keys or files, log files, 3uilt artifacts, IDE config files, and temporary files.</p>
