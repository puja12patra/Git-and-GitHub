    <h2>Definition of Version Control:</h2>
    <p>Version control - also known as source control or revision control - is an important software development
        practice for tracking and managing changes made to code and other files. <br>Version control is a system that tracks changes to a set of files over time. It allows developers to see
        who made what changes and when, and to revert to previous versions of the code if needed. Version control is
        essential for software development because it allows teams to collaborate on the same project without
        stepping on each other's toes.</p>

    <h3>Importance of Version Control in software development</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Collaboration</h3>makes it easy for multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time.
            Developers can create their own branches of the code to work on new features or fix bugs, and then merge
            their changes back into the main codebase once they are complete.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>History </h3>keeps a complete history of all changes to the code. This makes it easy to track down the source of
            a bug or to revert to a previous version of the code if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Backup</h3>serves as a backup for the code. If a developer accidentally deletes a file or makes a mistake,
            they can easily restore the file or revert to a previous version of the code.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Managing and Protecting the Source Code</h3>The Version Control System helps manage the source code for
            the software team by keeping track of all the code modifications. It also protects the source code from any
            unintended human error and consequences.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Auditing</h3>
            it can be used to audit changes to the code. This can be helpful for tracking down security
            vulnerabilities or for complying with regulations
        </li>
    </ul>
